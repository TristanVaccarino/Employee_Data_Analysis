# Employee Data Analysis

## Overview

### Background

 - Out of the 72,456 retirees 1,550 are eligable for the mentorship program
 - Only 2 retirees are managers

## Summary
- PH will be losing 72,456 employees with this upcoming "Silver tsunami." While the mentorship program is a good idea, the eligable mentors will have to take approximately 50 employees under their wing.

## Suggestions
- Instead of having the employees go under the retirees wing, create a virtual class or video lessons to cut down the amount of one-on-one time required to mentor new hires
- Recruit eligable people to help mentor the new hires
